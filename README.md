Mapbox with draggable polygon vertices.

## Getting Started

This app provides user with a map that has a polygon with draggable vertices, using mapbox_gl library.

Challenges faced:

- The Polygon provided by the library did not support dragging of vertices, so I decided to create a custome Polygon with Paint
